# **Ethical-Hacking-Studies**

Technical write-ups, custom ethical haking tools, and exploit research conducted in controlled environments.
This repository serves as a centralized hub for my offensive security research, CTF write-ups, and custom exploit development. The goal is to document my understanding of the cyber-attack lifecycle (Cyber Kill Chain / MITRE ATT&CK) and demonstrate proficiency in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.
