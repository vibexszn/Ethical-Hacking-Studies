Building on the insights gained from my passive and active reconnaissance, I will now leverage this intelligence to conduct a targeted vulnerability scan. This approach ensures the scan is precisely tuned to identify exploitable weaknesses within the specific attack surface discovered

__**TOOLS USED:**__

tcpdump

Wireshark

Nikto

**Methodologies:**

Automated Vulnerability Scanning

Web Server Benchmarking 

--------------------------------
Phase 1: Usage of tcpdump & nikto simultaneously

I initiated a Nikto vulnerability scan while simultaneously utilizing tcpdump to capture the underlying network traffic, which was subsequently analyzed in Wireshark to observe the scanner's behavior and the server's responses

_in the jpg above, i utilized tcpdump to capture raw network traffic and saved the output to niktoscan_capture1.pcap. This allows for a detailed post-scan analysis in Wireshark to validate the Nikto scan results and examine the specific request-response patterns_

_The Nikto scan successfully identified several potential vulnerabilities, these findings will be rigorously evaluated and detailed in the subsequent _Vulnerability Report_ section_ - _I performed a basic Nikto scan because reconnaissance identified only port 80 as open. However, had port 443 also been active, I would have enabled the -ssl flag to ensure a comprehensive vulnerability assessment across both the unencrypted and encrypted web services_

**_Wireshark Analysis:_** After capturing the network traffic of the Nikto scan against scanme.nmap.org, I performed a deep-packet analysis of the _.pcap file_ using Wireshark. This allowed me to dissect the interaction between the scanner and the target, providing a clear view of the HTTP request methods used and the server's subsequent responses

in the image png above, by using the _http.request.method == "GET" filter_, to isolate the scanner probes from background noise, revealing exactly which directories and sensitive files that were targeted for discovery. This analysis allows me to map the attacker intent by identifying _"200 OK"_ responses that confirm successful access to specific resources on the legacy Apache server.


I followed the TCP stream after filtering the packet to get the raw conversation between my machine and the web server, the result of the TCP stream are below

_**Key findings:**_

Verification of the server identity i got in the recon stage

Identification of the Page Content _<title> Go ahed and Scan Me!</title>_..this confirms that im directly interacting with the legitimate and authorized testing lab

Presence of Analytics and tracking, _ga('create', 'UA-11009417-1', 'auto');_ ..this means that the server is tracking visitor behavior
